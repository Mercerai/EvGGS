# Dataset

- Ev3D-S

    a large-scale synthetic Event-based dataset with varying textures and materials and accompanied by well-calibrated frame, depth, and silhouette groundtruth.

    Download the dataset from OneDrive...


- EV3D-R

    A large Event-based 3D dataset captured by a real event camera of EvGGS

    Download the dataset from [Baidu Disk](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1EuR-l_b_g-j_Du6dOxtZEg?pwd=3ilt ), code:3ilt

    Download the dataset from [OneDrive](https://hkustgz-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/junhaohe_hkust-gz_edu_cn/EY__SmcUSbdFs13sb2h8svYBXYOCDd0OVnSWV-WLfvFLmA?e=GkVjhd)

- Custom Dataset Instructions
    You can construct your custom datasets by the following steps:

    1. Render the scenario in Blender:
        - Put the object in the origin and let the camera trace bounded by a unit sphere.
        - The groundtruth pose, depth, and optical flow are generated by VisionBlender. 
    2. Record the event stream using your event cameras or convert the RGB image series using the [event converter V2E](https://github.com/SensorsINI/v2e)
    3. Align the groundtruth poses, depth, optical flows, and grayscale images with event streams.
    4. Dataset formats:
        - H5_Files: The aligned event streams stored in H5 files
        - Render_info: Grayscale images and .npz files which contain poses, depth, and optical flows.
        - Intrinsics: Camera intrinsics

Please contact us if you need to construct your custom event datasets.
